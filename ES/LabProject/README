1) Begin by running the project in Netbeans,
and access the page localhost:8080
This page provides the information of airplanes in motion.

2)
The page /logs provides information of the rest, boot load, errors etc... and  new data acquired.

The page /events are consumed messages from Kafka

The project workflow:
New airplane appears => Its saved in the database => produce a message under the topic events => this message is consumed by a thread called Event consumer and updates the rest information.
Same thing applys to the logs to make it possible to display on the Web Application.
